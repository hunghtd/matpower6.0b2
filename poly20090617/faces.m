%FACES find the faces defined by angles
%   FACES(A) finds the plane equations
%   Angles are triple of vertices.
%   The three points are used to compute the linear plane equation
%   Roundoff is removed by picking a representative value for each.
%   Multiple solutions are singled up by unique('rows')
